DAY 3 — Python Basics 3

Dictionaries
Nested data
Looping through data structures

1. Immutability: Why can you use a tuple as a dictionary key, but not a list? 

2. Performance: In terms of speed (Big O notation), is searching for a key in a Dictionary faster or slower than searching for a value in a List? (Answer: Dictionary is much faster—O(1) vs O(n)).

3. Methods: What is the difference between dict['key'] and dict.get('key')?

4. Syntax: How do you merge two dictionaries together in Python 3.9+? (Hint: Look up the | operator).

5. Logic: If I iterate over a dictionary using for x in my_dict:, what does variable x contain: the keys, the values, or the items?
